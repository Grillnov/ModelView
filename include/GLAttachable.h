/**
 * @brief Interface of a OpenGL attachable resource.
 *
 * A OpenGL resource in "Detached" mode means it's not in
 * OpenGL registry, however OpenGL objects could be created
 * by calling Attach().
 *
 * Before the OpenGL context is created, any call to gl* functions
 * is forbidden, but resources like meshes, textures could have buffer
 * prepared in memory, to reduce OpenGL object init time.
