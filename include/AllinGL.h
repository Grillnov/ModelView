/**
Due to the botched OpenGL support provided by Microsoft Windows OS, 
Glew has to be initiated to retrieve function pointers to GL interfaces.
Problems might arise if you are using an Intel graphic device(for instance, HD4000 series) on Windows platform.
If so, try and run the executable with independent video cards(for instance, your ATI or NVIDIA card).
Note that Glew has to be included before any gl headers are included.

TODO: GL3W may work if we fail to initiate glew.
